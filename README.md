# Flask-CRM-API
#### By David Cannan

This code includes:

> A SQLite database, created using SQLAlchemy ORM, with two tables: Contact and Interaction. Contacts have a one-to-many relationship with interactions, meaning one contact can have multiple interactions.
> Routes to display all contacts, add a new contact, edit an existing contact, delete a contact, and add a new interaction for a contact.

Note: This code assumes that you have flask, flask_sqlalchemy, and sqlite3 installed in your Python environment.

The HTML templates (like 'index.html') and further routes for searching and filtering contacts, recording and displaying interaction history, task lists, reminders, calendars, alerts, email templates, automation, performance tracking, productivity analysis, and data visualization are left for implementation.
